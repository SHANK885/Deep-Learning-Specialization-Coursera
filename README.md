# [Deep Learning Specialization on Courser](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

**Break into AI World by Mastering Deep Learning Fundamentals**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

This repository contains all my quizzes and programming assignmets work related to this specialization. All the codes, quiz questions and images has bee taken from [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Words From Me

I am a Computer Science graduate and a long-time self-taught learner. Apart from mandatory courses in my Curriculum I have completed several CS related **MOOCs** courses from **Coursera** and **NPTEL**. It takes a fair amaout of time and dedication when you try and learn new concepts.The reason why I am releasing this code is entirely for your **reference purpose only** as It may help you save you important time when you get stuck into something while solving the assignments or quizzes of this specialization (although all the assignments are easy if you watch all the lectures carefully and try to do it). This specialization has a very decent course content and which has been organised beautifully. Please try to understad the solution instead of just copying and pasting it. I am really thankful to deeplearning.ai team and Andrew Ng for providing such wonderfull course.
This repo contains all the assignment problems and quizzes to all the five courses of this specialization.
